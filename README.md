# POSSIBLE-X specific plugins for the [Omejdn server](https://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/omejdn-server)


This repository contains plugins that are used within the POSSIBLE-X project to achieve the usage of Omejdn as a DAPS
authentication server for use with EDC connectors. It is a fork of the MERLOT
project's [Omejdn plugins](https://github.com/merlot-education/omejdn-plugins)
repository and adds the possibility to retrieve and delete certificates.

**Warning: The plugins in this repository may contain endpoints that are not secured by any means of authentication.
These endpoints may be dangerous in production and must never be exposed to the Internet!**

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are made available by the connector API plugin:
